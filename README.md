# ToDo List
A to-do list is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure, including an input field for adding tasks and a list for displaying them. CSS styles the interface, making it visually appealing. JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing users to add, complete, and delete tasks dynamically.
